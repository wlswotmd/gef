## What is this?
This is a fork of [GEF](https://github.com/hugsy/gef).
However, it is specialized for x86 / x64 / ARM / ARM64, and various features are added.

## Setup

### Install (Ubuntu 22.04 or before)
```bash
# Run with root user (sudo is NOT recommended)
wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bata24/gef/dev/install.sh -O- | sh
```

GEF is installed under `/root` to simplify the installation script.
If you want to change the location, please modify accordingly.

### Install (Ubuntu 23.04 or after)
```bash
# Ubuntu 23.04 restricts global installation with pip3, so you need --break-system-packages option.
wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bata24/gef/dev/install.sh -O- | sed -e 's/\(pip3 install\)/\1 --break-system-packages/g' | sh
```

### Upgrade (replace itself)
```bash
python3 /root/.gdbinit-gef.py --upgrade
```

### Uninstall
```bash
rm -f /root/.gdbinit-gef.py /root/.gef.rc
sed -i -e '/source \/root\/.gdbinit-gef.py/d' /root/.gdbinit
```

### Dependency
See [install.sh](https://github.com/bata24/gef/blob/dev/install.sh) or
[install-minimal.sh](https://github.com/bata24/gef/blob/dev/install-minimal.sh).

## Supported environment
- Tested on Ubuntu 22.04.
- It may work under Ubuntu 20.04 and 23.04.

## Supported mode
* Normal debugging (start under gdb)
* Attach to the process
* Attach to the process in another pid namespace
* Connect to gdbserver
* Connect to the gdb stub of qemu-system (via localhost:1234)
* Connect to the gdb stub of qemu-user (via localhost:1234)
* Connect to the gdb stub of Intel Pin (via localhost:1234)
* Connect to the gdb stub of Intel SDE (via localhost:1234)

* Connect to the gdb stub of KGDB (over serial. currently, only gdb 12.x~ is supported)
* Connect to the gdb stub of VMWare (via ipaddr:port)

### Qemu-system cooperation
* Usage
    * Start qemu-system with the `-s` option and listen on `localhost:1234`.
    * Attach with `gdb-multiarch -ex 'target remote localhost:1234'`.
    * Or `gdb-multiarch -ex 'set architecture TARGET_ARCH' -ex 'target remote localhost:1234'` (for old qemu).
    * Most commands should work fine unless `CONFIG_RANDSTRUCT` is enabled.
    * It works with any version qemu-system, but qemu-6.x or higher is recommended.
* Supported architectures
    * x86, x64, ARM and ARM64

### Qemu-user cooperation
* Usage
    * Start qemu-user with the `-g 1234` option and listen on `localhost:1234`.
    * Attach with `gdb-multiarch /PATH/TO/BINARY -ex 'target remote localhost:1234'`.
    * Or `gdb-multiarch -ex 'set architecture TARGET_ARCH' -ex 'target remote localhost:1234'` (for old qemu).
    * It works with any version qemu-user, but qemu-6.x or higher is recommended.
* Supported architectures
    * See [QEMU-USER-SUPPORTED-ARCH.md](https://github.com/bata24/gef/blob/dev/QEMU-USER-SUPPORTED-ARCH.md)

### Intel Pin/SDE cooperation
* Usage for Intel Pin
    * Listen with `pin -appdebug -appdebug_server_port 1234 -t obj-intel64/inscount0.so -- /bin/ls`.
    * Attach with `gdb-multiarch /PATH/TO/BINARY -ex 'target remote localhost:1234'`.
* Usage for Intel SDE
    * Listen with `sde64 -debug -debug-port 1234 -- /bin/ls`.
    * Attach with `gdb-multiarch /PATH/TO/BINARY -ex 'target remote localhost:1234'`.
* Supported architectures
    * x64 only.
    * It runs very slowly and is not recommended.

### Qiling framework cooperation
* Usage
    * Write a harness. See [here](https://docs.qiling.io/en/latest/debugger/).
    * Attach with `gdb-multiarch /PATH/TO/BINARY -ex 'target remote localhost:9999'`.
* Supported architectures
    * x86, x64, ARM and ARM64.
    * On ARM64, the flag register is not available, so the branch taken/not detected is incorrect.
    * This is an experimental support.

### KGDB cooperation
* Usage
    * Host OS
        * Configure the serial port as a named pipe in your two (debugger/debuggee) virtual machine settings, such as VMware or VirtualBox.
    * Debuggee
        * Build the kernel as `CONFIG_KGDB=y`. Ubuntu has supported it by default.
        * Edit `/etc/default/grub` and append `kgdboc=ttyS0,115200 kgdbwait` to the end of `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT`.
        * Then `update-grub && reboot`.
    * Debugger
        * Attach with `gdb-multiarch -ex 'target remote /dev/ttyS0'`.
* Supported architectures
    * x64 only. It needs gdb 12.x or after.
    * It runs very slowly and is not recommended. Ctrl+C interrupt does not work.
    * Many commands are unsupported in KGDB mode since there is no way to access physical memory and control registers.

### VMware cooperation
* Usage
    * Host OS
        * Add following configurations to vmx file. See [here](https://communities.vmware.com/t5/VMware-Fusion-Discussions/Using-debugStub-to-debug-a-guest-linux-kernel/td-p/394906).
            * `debugStub.listen.guest64 = "TRUE"`
            * `debugStub.listen.guest64.remote = "TRUE"`
            * `debugStub.hideBreakpoints = "TRUE"`
            * `debugStub.port.guest64 = "1234"`
        * Start the guest OS normally.
    * Debugger
        * Attach with `gdb-multiarch -ex 'target remote <ipaddr>:1234'`.
* Supported architectures
    * x64 only.
    * It runs slowly but faster than KGDB mode. Ctrl+C interrupt works.
    * Many commands are unsupported in VMware mode yet. (ToDo).

## Added / improved features

### Qemu-system cooperation - General
* `qreg`: displays the register values from qemu-monitor (allows to get like `$cs` even under qemu 2.x).
    * It is shortcut for `monitor info registers`.
    * It also prints the details of the each bit of the system register when x64/x86.
    * ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bata24/gef/dev/images/qreg.png)
* `sysreg`: pretty prints system registers.

        * 32bit mode is NOT supported.
        * ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bata24/gef/dev/images/pagewalk-arm64.png)
        * Supported stage2 translation. This is EL1/EL2/EL3 pagewalk sample (HITCON CTF 2018 super_hexagon).
        * ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bata24/gef/dev/images/pagewalk-arm64-el123.png)
        * Secure memory scanning is supported, but you have to break in the secure world.
        * ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bata24/gef/dev/images/pagewalk-arm64-secure.png)
        * Pseudo page tables without detailed flags and permission can be output even in the normal world.
        * ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bata24/gef/dev/images/pagewalk-arm64-secure-pseudo.png)
    * ARM (only Cortex-A, LPAE/Non-LPAE, PL0/PL1)
        * ARM v7 base.
        * PL2 is NOT supported.
        * ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bata24/gef/dev/images/pagewalk-arm.png)
        * Secure memory scanning is supported, you don't have to break in the secure world (use register with `_S` suffix).
        * ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bata24/gef/dev/images/pagewalk-arm-secure.png)
* `v2p`/`p2v`: displays transformation virtual address <-> physical address.
    * ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bata24/gef/dev/images/v2p-p2v.png)
* `xp`: is a shortcut for physical memory dump.
    * ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bata24/gef/dev/images/xp.png)

### Qemu-system cooperation - Linux specific
* `ksymaddr-remote`: displays kallsyms information from scanning kernel memory (heuristic).
    * Supported kernel versions are not only before v6.1, but also after v6.2 (slightly changed structure in memory).
    * Supported kernel after v6.4 (changed structure in memory again).
    * ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bata24/gef/dev/images/ksymaddr-remote.png)
* `ksymaddr-remote-apply`: applies kallsyms information obtained by `ksymaddr-remote` to gdb.
    * ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bata24/gef/dev/images/ksymaddr-remote-apply.png)
* `vmlinux-to-elf-apply`: applies kallsyms information obtained by `vmlinux-to-elf` to gdb.
    * ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bata24/gef/dev/images/vmlinux-to-elf-apply1.png)
    * Once you get symboled vmlinux file, you can reuse and apply it automatically even after rebooting qemu-system.
    * ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bata24/gef/dev/images/vmlinux-to-elf-apply2.png)
    * TIPS: `vmlinux-to-elf-apply` and `ksymaddr-remote-apply` provide almost the same functionality.
        * For normal use, I think `vmlinux-to-elf-apply` is preferable because reusing image makes it faster.
        * For FGKASLR, I think `ksymaddr-remote-apply` is preferable because faster without reusing image.
* `slub-dump`: dumps slub free-list (heuristic).
    * Supported on x64/x86/ARM64/ARM + SLUB + no-symbol + kASLR.
    * Supported on both `CONFIG_SLAB_FREELIST_HARDENED` is `y` or `n`.
    * It supports to dump partial pages (`-v`) and NUMA node pages (`-vv`).
    * Since `page_to_virt` is difficult to implement, it will heuristically determine the virtual address from the freelist.
    * ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bata24/gef/dev/images/slub-dump.png)
* `slab-dump`: dumps slab free-list (heuristic).
    * Supported on x64 + SLAB + no-symbol + kASLR.
    * ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bata24/gef/dev/images/slab-dump.png)
* `slob-dump`: dumps slob free-list (heuristic).
    * Supported on x64 + SLOB + no-symbol + kASLR.
    * ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bata24/gef/dev/images/slob-dump.png)
* `slub-tiny-dump`: dumps slub-tiny free-list (heuristic).
    * Supported on x64/x86 + SLUB_TINY + no-symbol + kASLR.

    * It also dumps compat syscall table under ARM64.
* `thunk-tracer`: collects and displays the thunk function addresses that are called automatically (only x64/x86).
    * If this address comes from RW area, this is useful for getting RIP.

    * ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bata24/gef/dev/images/optee-break-ta.png)

### Qemu-user cooperation - General
* `si`/`ni`: are the wrapper for native `si`/`ni`.
    * On s390x architecture, a `PC not saved` error may be output when executing `stepi`/`nexti`.
    * But the execution itself is fine, so this command ignores this error and executes `context` normally.
    * On OpenRISC architecture, branch operations don't work well, so use breakpoints to simulate.
    * On Cris architecture, `stepi`/`nexti` commands don't work well, so use breakpoints to simulate.
    * If you want to use native `si`/`ni`, use the full form `stepi`/`nexti`.
* `c`: is the wrapper for native `c`.
    * When connecting to gdb stub of qemu-user or Intel Pin, gdb does not trap SIGINT during `continue`.
    * If you want to trap, you need to issue SIGINT on the qemu-user or pin side, but switching screens is troublesome.
    * This command realizes a pseudo SIGINT trap by trapping SIGINT on the python side and throwing SIGINT back to qemu-user or Intel Pin.
    * It works only local qemu-user or Intel Pin.
    * If you want to use native `c`, use the full form `continue`.

### Heap dump features
* `partition-alloc-dump`: dumps partition-alloc free-list (heuristic).
    * ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bata24/gef/dev/images/partition-alloc-dump.png)
    * This command is reserved for the implementation of latest version of chromium.
        * Currently tested: v117.x / 1176938 / f1dd439f69f177c9081dbe4f6b7e9d396388da8f
        * https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-snapshots/index.html?prefix=Linux_x64/1176938/

    * It will try heuristic search if binary has no symbol.
    * How to test:
        * See [partition-alloc-dump-dev/downloader.py](https://github.com/bata24/gef/blob/dev/partition-alloc-dump-dev/downloader.py).

    * ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bata24/gef/dev/images/musl-heap-dump.png)
    * How to test:
        * Get and extract latest source, then `./configure && make install`.
        * Build as `/usr/local/musl/bin/musl-gcc test.c`.
* `uclibc-ng-heap-dump`: dumps uClibc-ng heap chunks (heuristic).
    * Supported on x64/x86, based on uClibc-ng v1.0.42 malloc-standard.
    * ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bata24/gef/dev/images/uclibc-ng-heap-dump.png)
    * How to test (x64):
        * Download and extract `x86-64--uclibc--stable-2022.08-1.tar.bz2` from https://toolchains.bootlin.com/
        * Add `/path/to/toolchain/bin` to `$PATH`, then `x86_64-linux-gcc test.c`.
        * Fix interpreter by `patchelf --set-interpreter /PATH/TO/x86_64-buildroot-linux-uclibc/sysroot/lib/ld64-uClibc.so.0 a.out`.
* `optee-bget-dump`: dumps bget allocator of OPTEE-Trusted-App.

### Other
* The category is introduced in `gef help`.
    * ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bata24/gef/dev/images/gef-help.png)
* Combined into one file (from gef-extra). The followings are moved from gef-extras.
    * `peek-pointers`, `current-stack-frame`, `xref-telescope`, `bytearray`, and `bincompare`.
    * This is because a single file is more attractive than ease of maintenance.
* The system-call table used by `syscall-args` is moved from gef-extras.
    * It was updated up to linux kernel 6.4.9 for each architecture.
* Removed some features I don't use.
    * `$`, `ida-interact`, `gef-remote`, `pie`, `pcustom`, `ksymaddr`, `trace-run`, `bufferize`, `output redirect` and `shellcode`.
* Many bugs fix / formatting / made it easy for me to use.
