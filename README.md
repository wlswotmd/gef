## What is this?
This is a fork of [GEF](https://github.com/hugsy/gef).
However, there are 3 major improvements.

1. Added many heuristic commands for kernel debugging __WITHOUT symboled vmlinux__ (for qemu-system; linux kernel 3.x ~ 6.9.x).
2. Added support for [many architectures](https://github.com/bata24/gef/blob/dev/docs/QEMU-USER-SUPPORTED-ARCH.md) (for qemu-user).
3. Added some heap dump commands for various allocators.

Many other commands have been added and improved. Enjoy!

## Setup

### Install
```bash
# Ubuntu 23.04 or later restrict global installation of python packages with pip3.
# So you need --break-system-packages option.
wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bata24/gef/dev/install.sh -O- | sed -e 's/pip3 install/pip3 install --break-system-packages/g' | sh

```

* Note
    * To simplify the installation script, GEF (`gef.py`) is installed to a fixed path (`/root/.gdbinit-gef.py`).
    * Also, it registers the GEF path to `/root/.gdbinit`.
    * If you want to change the location, please modify both of them yourself.

### Upgrade
```bash
python3 /root/.gdbinit-gef.py --upgrade
```

### Uninstall
```bash
rm -f /root/.gdbinit-gef.py /root/.gef.rc
sed -i -e '/source \/root\/.gdbinit-gef.py/d' /root/.gdbinit
```

### Dependency
See [install.sh](https://github.com/bata24/gef/blob/dev/install.sh) or
[install-minimal.sh](https://github.com/bata24/gef/blob/dev/install-minimal.sh).

## Supported environment

### Qemu-user cooperation
* `si`/`ni`: are the wrapper for native `si`/`ni` if OpenRISC or cris.
    * On OpenRISC architecture, branch operations don't work well, so use breakpoints to simulate.
    * On cris architecture, `stepi`/`nexti` commands don't work well, so use breakpoints to simulate.
    * If you want to use native `si`/`ni`, use the full form `stepi`/`nexti`.
* `c`: is the wrapper for native `c` if gdb is connected to qemu-user or intel pin.
    * When connecting to gdb stub of qemu-user or Intel Pin, gdb does not trap SIGINT during `continue`.
    * If you want to trap, you need to issue SIGTRAP on the qemu-user or pin side, but switching screens is troublesome.
    * This command realizes a pseudo SIGTRAP trap by trapping SIGINT on the python side and throwing SIGTRAP back to qemu-user or Intel Pin.
    * It works only local qemu-user or Intel Pin.
    * If you want to use native `c`, use the full form `continue`.

        * ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bata24/gef/dev/images/find-fake-fast.png)
    * `visual-heap`: is colorized heap viewer.

    * `uclibc-ng-visual-heap`: is colorized heap viewer for uClibc-ng.
        * ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bata24/gef/dev/images/uclibc-ng-visual-heap.png)

    * ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bata24/gef/dev/images/dt.png)
    * This command is designed for several purposes.
        1. When displaying very large struct, you may want to go through a pager because the results will not fit on one screen.
           However, using a pager, the color information disappears. This command calls the pager with preserving colors.
        2. When `ptype /ox TYPE`, interpreting member type recursively often result is too long and difficult to read.
           This command keeps result compact by displaying only top-level members.
        3. When `p ((TYPE*) ADDRESS)[0]` for large struct, the setting of `max-value-size` is too small to display.
           This command adjusts it automatically.
        4. When debugging a binary written in the golang, the offset information of the type is not displayed.
           This command also displays the offset.
        5. When debugging a binary written in the golang, the `p ((TYPE*) ADDRESS)[0]` command will be broken.
           Because the golang helper script is automatically loaded and overwrites the behavior of `p` command.
           This command creates the display results on the python side, so we can display it without any problems.

### Other
* The category is introduced in `gef help`.
    * ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bata24/gef/dev/images/gef-help.png)
* Combined into one file (from gef-extra). The following are moved from gef-extras.
    * `peek-pointers`, `current-stack-frame`, `xref-telescope`, `bytearray`, and `bincompare`.
    * This is because a single file is more attractive than ease of maintenance.
* The system-call table used by `syscall-args` is moved from gef-extras.
    * It was updated up to linux kernel 6.10.0-rc3 for each architecture.
* Removed some features I don't use.
    * `$`, `ida-interact`, `gef-remote`, `pie`, `pcustom`, `ksymaddr`, `trace-run`, `bufferize`, `output redirect` and `shellcode`.
* Many bugs fix / formatting / made it easy for me to use.
